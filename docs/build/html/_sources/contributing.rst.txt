Bug Reports and Enhancements
============================

Users are encouraged to report any bugs or suggest enhancements on the
`issue tracker <https://github.com/zasexton/Synthetic-Vascular-Toolkit/issues>`_.
For bugs, users should fill out the **Bug Reporting Template** to ensure that a
thorough description of the problem is given for developers to address. If raised
issues are not able to be reproduced, they may be ignored. For enhancements, users
should fill out the **Enhancement Template**. Again users should be as thorough as
possible when describing the functionality they are seeking to add; this will help
developers determine where and how to add new functionality to the repository.

Pull Requests
-------------

This project is completely open-source! Users should feel free to clone the
repository and build onto the code as they require for their interests; however
if users seek to contribute to this project through pull requests, the pull request
*must* be associated with an open ticket on the `issue tracker
<https://github.com/zasexton/Synthetic-Vascular-Toolkit/issues>`_ and have a
designated member of the development team assigned to the ticket. This will ensure
that code can be efficiently merged with the main branch and fits into the long-term
roadmap for the project.

Questions and Comments
----------------------

For comments or questions, feel free to use the `Q&A board
<https://github.com/zasexton/Synthetic-Vascular-Toolkit/discussions/categories/q-a>`_!
Here users and developers can chat and ask questions to each other about project plans,
general repository information, or how to use SVT in their own project plans.

We also have a `show and tell board
<https://github.com/zasexton/Synthetic-Vascular-Toolkit/discussions/categories/show-and-tell>`_
where users can let the community know what cool applications they have with SVT!
